## How to install and Run the Project

The entire repo is a project created from the default intelliJ template but it can also be opened in other IDEs
such as eclipse and Netbeans. You can also just download the individual java files in the [src folder](src) and run them using the java compiler available on your OS.

## How to Use

The files are solutions i came up with and might not necessarily be optimal as i was still relatively new to programming but i plan to refine them with time.
